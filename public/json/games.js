This is a stick sniper masterpiece where you take on the role of an assassin who has lead a hard life full of cold blood and hot women. It's a dark world when you're an assassin for hire and even though he may be the best there is at what he does, that doesn't mean what he does is very nice! Use basic sniper mechanics to delve into the questionable past of this hitman as you rack up a kill count and blast your way through his story. This is a story based stick sniper shooter which brings the duo-tone world of hyper-violent stick games to life through its deep characterization, and complex storytelling. You'll be introduced to characters you might not like but you will definitely understand. You will be forced to question your own morals and ethics as you stare down the barrel of a gun and into the yawning chasm of imperfect humans. Stick games are a staple of the casual gaming industry. They have been around longer than any of us and will probably be around a lot longer than any of us. Clear Vision is a step above the rest.

Is it revenge, are you trying to save the world? Are you doing it just for the money? Only those who read through the multiple screens at the beginning of the game will know for sure.
